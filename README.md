# BIO-482 Miniproject  

Repository for the data analysis miniproject of the course Neuroscience: cellular and circuit mechanisms (BIO-482), EPFL. 

This repository contains a MATLAB and python version of this project, as well as associated functions used for computations.

## Setting up
### Download
- Clone `git clone ...` or download as zip file this repository (green button).
- Download `Data_Bio482.mat` dataset at the provided link,

The repository should contain the following folders:
- `doc`: documentation related to the project and to the data.
- `matlab`: code and helper functions to do the project with MATLAB.
- `python`: code and helper functions to do the project using Python.

**Note**: add the `.mat` file in a `bio482_miniproject/data` folder.

### Installation and usage

1. If you're using **MATLAB**:
  - Add the `/matlab` folder to your MATLAB path to run the code.
2. If you're using **Python**:
  - You need to have Anaconda installed for your system: [install anaconda here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html). 
  - Once Anaconda is installed, open a terminal and go to the `python` repository.
  - Install the provided "bio482" conda environment: `conda install env.yml`.
  - Close terminal to make the conda environment effective.
  
  Then, to work on the project:
  - Open a terminal and activate the environment: `conda activate bio482`.
  - Go to `python/notebooks` and open a terminal, then run: `jupyter notebook`.
  - Open notebooks to start working on the project.
